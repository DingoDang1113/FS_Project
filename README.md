weekday provides a Search function housed within its own component, embedded in the top header bar, allowing users to search for employees across different pages. Upon input of a letter, a dropdown menu displays the corresponding results of employees whose names contain that letter(s). Hovering over an item darkens the background to emphasize selection.
